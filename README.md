# *srt.lua*
A pure lua library to for SubRip (SRT) file parsing

## To do:
- [ ] Improve performance
- [ ] Extended formatting
	- [ ] Position flags
	- [ ] HTML Color and format like *italic*, **bold**, _Underlined_ ***and*** *everything* **in** ***between***
	- [ ] Other formats like ~~strikethrough~~

## Features
- Simple API
- Easy to work with

## Flaws
- Janky parsing routine
- Inefficient
- Probably will break if the time reaches over 99 hours

## Getting started
1. ðŸ“¡ Get a copy of srt.lua from the [Official Repository](https://github.com/alejandro-alzate/srt-lua) or [From Luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/alejandro-alzate/srt)
2. ðŸ’¾ Copy `srt.lua` where you like to use it, or just on the root directory of the project
3. âš™ Add it to your project like this
	```lua
	local srt = require("path/to/srt")
	```
4. ðŸ“ƒ Pass a plain text representation of the file
	```lua
	local captionsData = read("path/to/captions")
	local captionsObject = srt.new(captionsData)
	```
5. ðŸŽ¬ Tell in what part of the media we are right now, since this is a generic pure lua function a better example is done with the [LÃ–VE2D framework](love2d.org), so we can get a real world example
	```lua
	local coolVideo = love.graphics.newVideo("path/to/cool/video.ogg")

	function love.update(dt)
		--A media source on love returns a number in seconds when the method :tell() is called
		--srt.lua takes the elapsed time in seconds so be aware of passing seconds as an integer
		local tellTime = coolVideo:tell()

		--We pass the time elapsed in seconds
		captionsObject:setTime(tellTime)

		--We tell srt.lua to apply changes, an optional argument is the delta so we account the lag
		--This method has been deprecated since setTime calls it internally but has not been removed
		--For the lag compesation feature that has. Beware of not using it alone since you could get
		--out of sync with the media being played with.
		captionsObject:update(dt)
	end
	```
6. ðŸ’Ž Profit.
	(jokes aside once changes are applied we can ask for the text and use it,
	âš  But take note that the result is raw from the file,
	so any gibberish has to be cleaned mannually r/NotMyJob)
	```lua
	function love.draw()
		--We draw the video
		love.graphics.draw(coolVideo)

		--We draw the subs
		love.graphics.setFont(48)
		local captionsText = captionsObject:getText()
		local windowWidth, windowHeight = love.graphics.getDimensions()
		love.graphics.print(captionsText, 0, windowHeight - 48)
	end

	```
